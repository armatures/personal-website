teaser: What are the common patterns in project management?
---
I have always wanted to write about something that I have been thinking about
for quite a while. That is, what the common patterns in project management are.
I've been exposed to both software development and project management for quite
some time, and I am starting to see parallels between the two.
Both follow some kind of structured process to achieve a more or less defined
outcome. Both are concerned with organizing work in the big and in the small.
Both can bring an organization to new heights or make it fall to rock bottom.
Both bear fruit despite all the right things being done the wrong way.

One thing observed in software development is that patterns for doing certain
things are given names and sometime are followed with passionate rigor. In the
disciple of object oriented programming that is usually called a design
pattern. With many proponents and opponents it was something that originally
was born out of the observation that often classes and objects are organized in
frequently occurring patterns and that giving these patterns makes
communicating these simpler. So instead of saying “that thing that hides away a
hard to use legacy API and allows us to use it with our own interface
specification “ can now just be called “Adapter pattern”. And when you want to
describe how to solve a problem you can then just say “this sounds like
something where an adapter pattern could come in useful”. It is important to
mention at this point that the design patterns were born out of real world
observations, not some kind of ivory tower thought process that thought about
how to write software in some perfect world. The reality is that as software
developers we often have to make the impossible work given impossible deadlines
and legacy APIs that will make you want to rip your hair out.

Design patterns are given names as a communication tool and as means to think
and conceive problem solutions that are clear and precise. Recently it has come
to my mind that

Patterns can be

- how to capture tasks
- how to organize meetings
-

# Pattern: The design spiral

# Pattern: The re-sync
