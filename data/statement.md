## Statement

Let me show you how I __can help your business become more profitable__.

The hard-to-swallow truth is that any technology you invest in will become
_outdated and inefficient_ in the next __X__ years. Your initial promise to the
investors that you will truly disrupt the world by using the latest
artisanal hipster tech stacks will grow meaningless as time passes.

I will help you get up to speed with real-world demands, such as providing
__shareholder value__ and getting from __revenue to profit__. In the end, if you
are not in it to find a sustainable, repeatable business model, _why bother_?

The real-world challenges you will inevitably face are going to involve
massive heaps of data that will make no sense. There will be unwieldy
monoliths and microservices that keep breaking and cause you to churn
users like a leaky bucket. Your marketing strategy sounds good in theory,
but you don't know how to translate it into automated actions.

Using Docker or `NEW_TECHNOLOGY` will not solve this. __You are not Google.
You are not Facebook__ and able to spend 7 digit budgets on optimizing
one pixel on your landing page.

On the other hand, using time-tested tools that help my clients lower
infrastructure costs by __50%__ or using 30 year old UNIX tools in order to
increase your data pipeline speed by __8x__ will help you further your business
goals. Your customer does not care how you __get the job done__. _On the
internet, nobody knows you are agile._

Never have tools mattered less than now. This is the time where individuals
with the skill to adapt to any business challenge life throws at you thrive.

There are two knobs in your business. __Revenue and Cost__. Those that know how
to turn both are going to make you rich.

In order to find out how I can help you reach your goals, feel free to get in
touch with me and I will take care of you personally.
