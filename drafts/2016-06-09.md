title: Entropy, Exploitation and Economy
language: python
---
Economy will not work without exploiting resources. Over time entropy
increases. If entropy too high economy collapses. Entropy is lowered by
discovering new resources.

We will present a way of measuring entropy and how entropy can be shown to
lower by introducing new means of exploiting resources

## What is the purpose of economy

From a bottom-up view it is about efficiently satisfying human desires, as can
be described using [Maslow's hierarchy of
needs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs)

## What is exploitation
It was hard to find resources for this as exploitation is most commonly
understood as the exploitation of human resources, i.e. paying workers
unfair wages and forcing them to be in working conditions that are damaging
to them and their communities.

## Supply chain
Every [supply chain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain) starts with
the exploitation of natural resources.

> Supply chain activities involve the transformation of natural resources, raw
> materials, and components into a finished product that is delivered to the
> end customer

### Physiological

- air
- water
- food
- clothing
- shelter

### Safety

- personal and financial security
- health

### Love belonging
- sex and procreation

Wikipedia is doing a better job at dissecting the layers so I will focus on
what is important.

### Self-Actualization
- fuel for curiosity
- accomplishment

## Glossary

Resources = any means of turning non-human owned matter into capital
Capital = means of exchange

```python
from faker import Faker
from simpy import Environment

faker = Faker()

class Individuum:
    def __init__(self, env):
        self.name = faker.name()
        self.account = 0
        self.env = env
        env.

    def run():
        while True:
            print(self.name)
            yield env.timeout(1)
```

```python
env = Environment()
for _ in range(10):
    Individuum(env)
env.run(until=2)
```
