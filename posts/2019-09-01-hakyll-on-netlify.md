If you are like me, you are more busy switching between static site generators
than actually writing posts for your blog. If you take a closer look at the
[commit history](https://github.com/justuswilhelm/personal-website/commits/master) for this website, you will notice that I have
switched site generators several times (including to and away from my own site
generator) But who can resist the appeal of yet another static site generator
that promises some combination of

- easy content editing
- ridiculously simple deployment
- blazing fast build times
- a vibrant plugin ecosystem that will support every flavor of Markdown
- easy to extend
- sane configuration that works for everyone

This time I have chosen a fabulous site generator toolkit called
[hakyll](https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/). Hakyll is a static site generator
implemented in Haskell. It uses a DSL for configuration and allows its user to
build their site in almost any way they like. Completely custom URL schema? No
problem. Compile the same file using several different compilers, including
Pandoc? No problem. Compile to one easy to deploy static executable, including
all your configuration? No problem.

Now recalling the advantages that every shiny static site generator out there
promises to have, we quickly notice that Hakyll has

- easy content editing -- only when set up correctly,
- ridiculously simple deployment -- once you manage to correctly install and
  master Haskell and [Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/)
- blazing fast build times -- if you ignore that a clean build of the generator
  itself will take 15 minutes
- no vibrant plugin ecosystem -- but a vibrant ecosystem of tutorials and
  snippets in the lower 100's range,
- easy extensibility -- if you are willing to put in the extra effort of
  learning what Monads are, since they're used everywhere, and a
- sane default configuration -- which only does 20 % of what Jekyll can
  do out of the box (like pagination, liquid templates, data files).

As you can see, there are a lot of places where Hakyll can only shine once you
spend a considerable amount of time configuring everything. But what might
sound like a big drawback is actually Hakyll's biggest advantage. Not many site
generators give you the ability to make something tailored exactly to what you
are doing. The next level of course would be to make your own site generator.

And, this is what I've done previously. My blog once was a Flask site turned
into a bundle of static HTML using [Frozen
Flask](https://pythonhosted.org/Frozen-Flask/). So, if Jekyll is on _one end_
of the site generator spectrum -- thanks to its batteries-included approach, then
building your own static site generator in Python is clearly on the _other end_
of the spectrum, even with the advantage of using powerful Jinja 2 templates
inside Flask. You are forced to do everything yourself. That includes the
boring stuff such as watching your Markdown files and other assets and
performing live rebuilds for local testing.

Of course, creating your own site generator is a valuable experience. It can
teach you a lot about how to design a good build system. At the same time, we
often need some more complicated features that just take a lot of time to
implement from scratch by yourself. For example, one of those advanced features
is tight integration with external tools and using those tools to provide
several build versions of the same blog post that is written in Markdown.
Exactly this is what ultimately led me to choose Hakyll for my personal
website.

My ideal workflow for blog posts and other pages on this site would look as
follows

1. Write a rough draft of what I want to say in Markdown.
2. Start a live build version and check how my initial draft _feels_ on screen.
3. Create illustrations and charts as needed to illustrate my point, while
4. continuing to edit and write my post.
5. Publish by doing a `git commit` followed by `git push`.

With Jekyll or any other popular static site generator especially the last step
is simple. Netlify support Jekyll [quite
well](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2015/10/28/a-step-by-step-guide-jekyll-3.0-on-netlify/)
and can be set up within 10 minutes. Here, I am not willing to compromise and I
would like to keep things simple and reliable. Where I always felt Jekyll was
lacking, was in external tooling support. I am a big fan of
[Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/), [Graphviz](https://www.graphviz.org/) and
[mscgen](http://www.mcternan.me.uk/mscgen/). Pandoc allows me to use the best
of Latex, while [Pandoc filters](https://pandoc.org/filters.html) allow me to
easily add external tools, including Graphviz and mscgen.

For a while I used [jekyll-graphviz](https://github.com/kui/jekyll-graphviz),
and it worked fine. Furthermore, there is a second plugin for Jekyll, that
allows you to use Pandoc. But it doesn't go so well with jekyll-graphviz, and I
really want to avoid using any non-Pandoc-syntax. And Jekyll plugins mostly
work by creating custom liquid tags, so that I would need to type

```
{% graph some graph title %}
a -- b
b -- c
c -- a
{% endgraph %}
```

every time. The preferred way for Pandoc filters would be more like this:

```
~~~
digraph G {Hello->World}
~~~
```

[(Source)](https://github.com/jgm/pandocfilters/blob/master/examples/graphviz-sample.md)

At some point when you go down the customization road, you will discover that
you need something that was made with _extreme_ customizability in mind. That
means, no implicit configuration, a better configuration language, and ideally
something that blends configuring the site with writing your own
customizations.

Haskell's approach to this has always been using Domain Specific Languages
(DSLs). On the one hand, you have a library of words that can do a few things
really well, but since on the other hand you are writing plain Haskell, you can
drop into your own custom code anytime you want. Jekyll, which is based on
Ruby, would have you drop your plugin files in certain folders, and that would
work fine, but the degree of _implicitness_ was always nagging me.

Then, we should also consider that Pandoc just _happens_ to be written in
Haskell, and there is this wonderful static site generation toolkit called
Hakyll. So after some careful pondering, I decided to venture into static site
generator customization land for the fifth time or so.

And here we are, roughly 2000 lines (delta) of fresh code later. I started off
using the sample Hakyll configuration and I've added a few things:

- Automatic table of content generation using Pandoc, thanks to [Gwern](https://www.gwern.net/hakyll.hs). My implementation can be found [here](https://github.com/justuswilhelm/personal-website/blob/9b1d805512e4b6169931e6554199db877bd84e13/site.hs#L100).
- Teaser extraction, thanks to [this
  tutorial](https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/tutorials/using-teasers-in-hakyll.html).
  My implementation can be found here
  [here](https://github.com/justuswilhelm/personal-website/blob/9b1d805512e4b6169931e6554199db877bd84e13/site.hs#L40).
- Sitemap generation, thanks to [this
  tutorial](https://www.rohanjain.in/hakyll-sitemap/). My implementation can be
  found
  [here](https://github.com/justuswilhelm/personal-website/blob/9b1d805512e4b6169931e6554199db877bd84e13/site.hs#L63).
- A Pandoc graphviz filter, thanks to this [Pandoc
  filter](https://github.com/jpierre03/pandoc-filter-graphviz). My
  modifications can be found
  [here](https://github.com/justuswilhelm/personal-website/blob/9b1d805512e4b6169931e6554199db877bd84e13/PandocFilterGraphviz.hs#L89).
- A Pandoc mscgen filter, inspired by the above filter, to be found
  [here](https://github.com/justuswilhelm/personal-website/blob/9b1d805512e4b6169931e6554199db877bd84e13/PandocFilterGraphviz.hs#L95).
- A Netlify deploy using CircleCI, as implemented
  [here](https://github.com/justuswilhelm/personal-website/blob/9b1d805512e4b6169931e6554199db877bd84e13/.circleci/config.yml#L1)

What does all of this buy me? Extremely fast site building speeds. The static
site generator code for Hakyll and Pandoc are compiled into one executable,
including all the filters that I've defined. Whereas in Jekyll, using Pandoc
with filters would have meant Jekyll spawning a Pandoc process per document,
and each Pandoc process spawning a filter configured via the `--filter` option.
Here, the main cost is not forking itself, but the startup time for each
subprocess.

Then, in the Hakyll version I've just created one big switch statement that
checks what to do when it encounters a \`\`\` block:

```haskell
renderAll :: Block -> IO Block
renderAll cblock@(CodeBlock (id, classes, attrs) content)
  | "msc" `elem` classes =
    let dest = fileName4Code "mscgen" (T.pack content) (Just "msc")
     in do ensureFile dest >> writeFile dest content
           % Do mscgen things here
  | "graphviz" `elem` classes =
    let dest = fileName4Code "graphviz" (T.pack content) (Just "dot")
     in do ensureFile dest >> writeFile dest content
           % Do Graphviz things here
  | otherwise = return cblock
  where
    image img =
      Para
        % Insert the image here
renderAll x = return x
```

The full code can be found
[here](https://github.com/justuswilhelm/personal-website/blob/9b1d805512e4b6169931e6554199db877bd84e13/PandocFilterGraphviz.hs#L101).
If I ever want to add any new diagramming tools, I can just extend the
`renderAll` function.

Then, the question remains: Why bother with all of this?

# Writing in Freedom

Every few years or so, a blogging platform announces itself and promises to be
the one place where writers can gather and exchange stories, while unburdened
with paywalls, dubious content licensing, sudden changes in content policies,
and so on.

So far, every single blogging platform has disappointed in some way. Tumblr has
suddenly decided to strictly forbid all adult content. Medium started adding
paywalls and pesters users even when reading free articles.

When I write text and publish it, then I express my opinions and views. I take
some time off my day to sit down and share my thoughts with others, hoping that
I will be able to find someone out there with whom I can engage in a deep
conversation. I am convinced that engaging in a meaningful conversation
requires freedom. Freedom from any platform agenda, freedom from the pressures
of capital, and the freedom of knowing that your opinions and that what you
express can reach others exactly as you intend.

If I can influence how my content is rendered, what the impression people have
when they reach my site, and ultimately what ideas will stick with my audience,
then I feel I have freedom. This freedom of course also comes with the downside
that if I'm clumsy at designing my site, not optimizing for usability or
accessibility, if my site goes down, then my ideas will have been expressed in
vain. The upside though, makes it worth it. If I can make my site work and
reach someone, I have reached my goal.
