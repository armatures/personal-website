Let's look at how 大切、大事、重要 are different.

## 大事 and 大切

Yep, both have the same meaning. Both mean

> 大事なアルバム

> This album is important (to me)

## 重要

This adjective serves to identify concepts as important in a context that
transcends one's own preference and identity.

> 重要なアルバム

> This album is important (in the history of music)

## Conclusion

大事 and 大切 come very close to the English word _important_. 重要 is about
expressing importance in the context of something larger.

## Reference

I'm basing this off this
