    "# Exploring Python dis\n",
    "As you might know, CPython, the most commonly used implementation of Python, uses a stack based virtual machine to run Python scripts. This means that Python scripts never get directly executed but turned into bytecode first. This allows for some optimisations during the bytecode compilation step and shipping of bytecode files (`.pyc` files) to end customers instead of raw scripts. [Ableton Live](https://www.ableton.com/en/live/) ships with a CPython interpreter for its MIDI hardware integration, but does not let users look at the actual hardware integration scripts and only includes the compiled versions of the individual scripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what exactly can be found in CPython bytecode? Enter the Python disassembly library [dis](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dis.html). It is included in the Python standard library and allows developers to view and understand the internal [bytecode](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-bytecode) representation of code objects in CPython. Other implementations of Python might not use an internal bytecode representation, so this is highly CPython specific.\n",

    "That does not look very helpful. Thankfully, the `dis` module has a `opname` list, that maps bytecode instructions (opcodes) to human readable names, similar to assembler instruction mnemonics such as MOV, ADD, etc. We need to keep in mind though, that we cannot just run all bytes through the `opnamp` list, as some instructions can have an attribute. Therefore, not all bytes in a bytecode object represent bytecode instructions. Let's try it out, then we will see if there is a problem."
